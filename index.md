**Hello there! Welcome to Joshua Born's official site!**

**About Joshua Born:**
Hello there! I am a 3ds modder and creator of "Gitshop" and "JBKart7." I am working on these 2 softwares and they will be downloadable once they are complete. I like creating 3ds mods. I also play Roblox and my account is "JoshuaB0RN."

**About JBKart7:**
JBKart7 is a Mario Kart 7 ROM hack that will bring new UIs, characters and karts, even custom tracks and custom music! You need Homebrew on your 3ds console and the JBKart7 CIA. It will be available in the future and a download for the ROM hack will be added here once it is finished.

**About Gitshop:**
Gitshop is an open source freeShop clone that will not need title keys. It will download them itself and will be set up as soon as you download the CIA onto your 3ds. It will be available once it is complete!
